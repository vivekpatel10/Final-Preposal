# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO

The Game
(Only reason because if some goes "hey you play The game yet" and they go "what game", then they fight on what The game is called)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO

Well, I want to create a game that requires people to run away from a covid molecule, basically like the same at the temple run but completely reinvented with covid. 


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO

Well my project has not be finalized yet so I do apologize, but I am not going to lie this app idea I had for a while, I was going to remake the Temple run/subway surfers app into a Covid-19 run type of game. Either where it is an infinite game from running or I have levels where you have to run and reach certain points to beat levels. I will make it for the IOS developer program. I will be using Swift code to create the whole thing. I will hopefully make a good enough app that I can publish it to the App Store. In doing so I want to include in app purchases or ways players can get coins in the game and buy boosts that will help them survive longer in "The game". Hopefully I can get it done, I am quite excited



## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable
N/A


## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO

Good outcome is that my app actually opens and runs to a certain extent, with a couple of bugs I can fix before I ever publish it.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO

A better outcome is that my app works and runs properly, with a few bugs that I will fix before I ever publish it 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO

The best outcome is that my app works and runs properly, with little to no bugs involved, and I am able to publish it right away, I hope that this happens


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO

Well, I need to first finalize my idea completely, at the moment I am still on the edge on what I completely want to do. Once I get that concrete foundation, I will structure an outline that will go through about 15 steps that will go each stage of the design process or the process I will create. I want to also incorporate testing phases during this, to make sure it continues to work till the end. I have do know whether to make a game go on forever, or make it have an end point. I want to research proper games that have become big, and why they were so successful to see if I can include any of that. Nonetheless, I want to research on other people process they had when they went into creating an app/game. I want to make sure to write down what they recommend to do and what to stay away from. Im hoping to research enough to the point if I hit bumps I am not deterred away and know what to do next, I do get quite frustrated at times, so this will help. I am working alone for this because I know I can do it.
