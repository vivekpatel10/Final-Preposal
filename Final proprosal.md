# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

TODO
First learn mobile and website design, I want to do both, I will turn in the mobile apps, but for just due to my curiosity, I wanna do it. 
Then go through the ideas I have thought for apps designs, for apple products.

I want to do make an app around COVID, sort of an app for contact tracing and it makes people taking short surveys that go over if they have symptoms or not, and whether they should get tested or not. 
However, I do know that is a very difficult idea.
My backup ideas are to create games, like almost temple run like, but its run from covid. So you are in a suit, running from a hoard of people who have covid, or a gas that represents covid. 
 
 
## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

TODO
I wanted to do this project by myself just so I know how to problem solve on my own.


## Do you have any questions of your own?

TODO
None anymore, asked most during class
